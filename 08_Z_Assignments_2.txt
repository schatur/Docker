Your company is ready to move forward with using Docker to run their applications. However, they have some complex container apps that can take advantage of the cluster management and orchestration features of Docker swarm. You have been asked to stand up a simple Docker swarm cluster to be used for some initial testing. A set of servers has already been provisioned for this purpose. The swarm cluster should meet the following criteria:

One Swarm manager.
Two worker nodes.
All nodes should use Docker CE version 5:18.09.5~3-0~ubuntu-bionic.
Both worker nodes should be joined to the cluster.
Any non-root user should be able to run docker commands on all three servers.

[NOTE: Write the series of commands to achieve above in this file below the question scenario with documentation]

Good luck!

Swarm Manager
------------------------------------
Initialize the Docker Swarm mode by running the following docker command on the 'dockermanager' node.
docker swarm init --advertise-addr <manager node IP address>
docker swarm init --advertise-addr 192.168.1.103

Two worker node
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Edit the /etc/hosts file across all three nodes via gedit or vim and do the following changes:

dockermanager
dockerworker1
dockerworker2
Update the apt package index:
# apt-get update
Install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS:
apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common -y
Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key:
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
Use the following command to set up the stable repository:
add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"

Again update the apt package:
# apt-get update
Install the latest version of Docker CE:
apt-get install docker-ce

After the installation is complete, start the docker service and enable it to launch every time at system boot.
# systemctl start docker
# systemctl enable docker

Both worker nodes should be joined to the cluster.
Now, to join the worker nodes to the swarm, 
we will run the docker swarm join command on all worker nodes which we received in the swarm initialization step:
docker swarm join --token ActualToken <manager-ip-address:port>

Any non-root user should be able to run docker commands on all three servers.

sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker manager
sudo usermod -aG docker worker1
sudo usermod -aG docker worker2
