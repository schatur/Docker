Your supermarket company is working on expanding their Docker infrastructure. They have an existing service that provides a list of fruit sold in their stores. After measuring the amount of load on this service, they have asked you to scale this service up to a higher number of replicas.

In addition, there is a new service that provides a list of vegetables. This new service needs to be created in the cluster. Set up the swarm cluster to complete the lab, ensure that the swarm meets the following specifications:

1. Scale the service called products-fruit to 5 replicas.
2. Create a new service called products-vegetables running the linuxacademycontent/vegetable-service:1.0.0 image.
3. Publish products-vegetables on port 8081. The application listens on port 80.
4. Run products-vegetables with 3 replicas.

You can test the products-fruit service from any swarm node (including the manager) with curl localhost:8080.

Once products-vegetables is running, you should be able to test it from any swarm node (including the manager) with curl localhost:8081.

Good luck!

$ docker swarm init
Swarm initialized: current node (wwqz348tplr3ars27muflwdvi) is now a manager.

To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:

    docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-3frbpftos6u13subsee28708w6ezauasdv96mhp60wj1p9rnj2-4gww371ifzv6j5m0u2wbi7egf 172.17.0.36:2377

To add a manager to this swarm, run 'docker swarm join-token manager' and follow the instructions

host01 $ docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-31kezav5e6cwejxjyu1uvpkdbdtcxvinu07seaonornc9vp7dr-eb0ajzs51iyq78lckxpjx80c4 172.17.0.48:2377
This node joined a swarm as a worker.
